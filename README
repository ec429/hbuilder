hbuilder - Harris aircraft designer

"It's like SpringStyle, but for bombers."

This is a speculative/long-term project to add the ability for players in
 Harris to design their own aircraft, according to the technologies that
 have been researched by the 'boffins'.

Most of the relevant gameplay rules haven't been nailed down yet; currently
 we're just experimenting with the design calculations.

hb.py implements an early prototype of the calculator, without tech levels.
hbuilder (the C program) implements the full calculator, and an interactive
 frontend to drive it.  Further experimentation is likely to uncover some
 infelicities in the existing design calculations...

hbuilder is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2.

USING THE EDITOR

The editor's (somewhat primitive) UI is conversational, with most actions
 driven by single-character commands.  In the main mode these commands are
 displayed by a help banner at program startup, which can be re-shown with
 the H command.
All command letters except Q are case-insensitive; however, keys to select
 from a list are case-sensitive.

MAIN MODE COMMANDS

I (info) will show the current design inputs, along with a mnemonic for the
 command to edit each input.  For instance, the line
    [W]ing: 200 sq ft; aspect ratio 7.0; [C]rew: PN
 indicates that the W command can be used to edit the wing area or aspect
 ratio, while the C command can be used to edit the crew; the current
 settings of these values are also shown.

Return (newline) will show the current design outputs, including breakdowns
 of weight and cost, and performance figures.
The Survivability figure is split in two for before/after the enemy mounts
 Schräge Musik upward-firing guns on fighters, and is followed by some
 intermediate results from the calculation (in all cases lower is better):
 - roll and turn are manœuvrability figures
 - evade is a combination of manœuvrability and height/speed to avoid
   fighter attack
 - vuln(erability) is susceptibility to damage
 - fr (fuel ratio) is weight of fuel divided by tare weight of wings (this
   contributes to vuln through fire risk)
Prototype and Production give the time and cost required to build and test
 a prototype and to tool up for series production of the design.

Q (quit) will exit without saving; for this reason it must be pressed twice
 in a row with no intervening commands, and unlike most commands must be in
 uppercase.

D (dump) will generate a "dump block", a series of commands that should
 regenerate the current design.  This is a primitive 'save' option until a
 proper file format is implemented.  Note that the commands in the dump
 block will only function correctly if the technology state allows for all
 the enumerated items used by the design.

X (review) will re-display any warnings or errors.

The editing commands (METWCBFLUR) each enter a mode to edit that specific
 aspect of the design, detailed in the next section.

EDITING COMMANDS

[M]anufacturer displays a list of available manufacturers, and keypresses
 to select them (by default these are numbers, but if there are more than
 nine options in the data files then they just continue in ASCII order,
 starting with ':').  Pressing 0 will leave the mode without making any
 changes.
Each manufacturer has its own set of bonuses and maluses which apply to the
 design.  These are described in human-readable form in file `hbm`; the
 machine-readable data are in file `manu`.
When the builder is integrated into Harris, each manufacturer will only be
 able to have one design under development (prototyping or tooling for mass
 production) at a time, so the optimal manufacturer may not be available,
 and you may have to choose one with less valuable bonuses to the design.

[E]ngines displays a list of available engines, selected with letter keys.
 Pressing a number will set the engine count, or 0 will leave the mode
 without making any changes.
Stats for each engine are defined in file `eng`.  These include 'SCL', or
 supercharging level (1=single-speed, 2=two-speed, 3=two-stage), which
 affects high-altitude performance.

[T]urrets displays available turrets to add, selected with letter keys;
 also existing turrets to remove, selected with number keys.  As usual, 0
 will leave the mode without making any changes.
Each turret takes up one of six location slots; you cannot add two turrets
 to the same slot.  Moreover, the nose slot is unavailable if you have an
 odd number of engines.  Survivability is helped by having guns covering
 several directions, but the weight and drag of the turrets will reduce
 aircraft performance.  Stats for each turret are defined in file `guns`.

[W]ing gives the choice of two sub-modes; press A to set the wing area or
 R to set the aspect ratio.  Then, enter an integer; note that for [R]atio
 this is in units of 0.1.

[C]rew can be used to add a crewman (either a [P]ilot, [N]avigator, [B]omb-
 aimer, [W]ireless-op, [E]ngineer or [G]unner), remove an existing crewman
 (by index in the list, e.g. [3] removes the third crewman), or toggle
 whether a crewman should dual-rôle as a gunner ([*] followed by number).
 Dual-rôling generally reduces a crewman's effectiveness in his primary
 rôle, and some crew types (P, N, B) can only operate specific kinds of gun
 mounts or turrets.  Engineers cannot dual-rôle at all.
Every aircraft must have a Pilot and Navigator.  There are generally
 diminishing returns to having more than one of anything other than
 Gunners.  The value of Wireless-ops occurs mostly on an operational level
 that doesn't appear in the stats calculated by the editor.

[B]omb bay has sub-modes; input [B]omb capacity in lb, or select [G]irth
 (from [S]mall, [M]edium or [C]ookie).  Or choose between a [R]egular bomb-
 sight and a Mark XIV [C]ourse-Setting bomb sight (if developed).
Girth determines whether the aircraft can carry High Capacity bombs such as
 the 4,000lb "cookie"; Medium cannot close the doors over a cookie so
 incurs a speed penalty when carrying it (6% in the current Harris code),
 while Small cannot carry it at all.  Selecting a greater girth incurs a
 tare weight penalty.
The Course-Setting bomb sight improves bombing accuracy significantly.

[F]uselage offers a choice of fuselage types, selected with number keys.
 Slender fuselages offer lower tare weight and drag, but increase cost and
 vulnerability, and reduce serviceability and reliability, from cramming
 lots of equipment into a narrow space.  Slab-sided fuselages are even
 lighter, but draggy; they are cheap to produce and easy to maintain.  Some
 early gun turrets may require a slab-sided fuselage.  Geodetic structure
 (only available from Vickers) is a little heavier and draggier than Normal
 fuselages, but is very rugged and robust, improving survivability and
 serviceability.

[L] offers a choice of electric supply levels.  Low power electrics only
 drive the aircraft's essential systems; the GEE navaid requires high power
 electrics, while sophisticated navaids like OBOE, H2S and GEE-H need the
 level 3 'stable voltage supply'.  Higher-level electric systems increase
 cost, particularly for aircraft with few engines; the combination of level
 3 electrics with a slender fuselage incurs an additional cost penalty.
 Alternatively, the [N]avaid sub-mode lets you add (letters) or remove
 (numbers) navaids, which have special nonlinear effects in-game on
 navigational accuracy.

[U] has a sub-mode [U] to set the fuel capacity in tenths of an hour;
 alternatively select [R]egular or [S]elf-sealing tanks, or press 0 to
 leave the mode without making changes.
Self-sealing fuel tanks greatly reduce vulnerability, though increase tare
 weight and cost.

[R]esearch doesn't edit the aircraft directly, rather it allows you to
 alter the technology levels used to calculate the design (which may also
 unlock various items in the editor such as engines, turrets, electric
 supply levels or self-sealing tanks).  In-game you would only be able to
 design with whatever tech level you have at the time, but in the stand-
 alone editor you can explore to your heart's content.
Techs have an approximate year (though in-game they may unlock sooner or
 later than this); pressing [@] allows you to enter a year to unlock all
 techs up to that year and lock all later techs.  Year 2 techs are
 available from the start of the game, but not available for the bulk of
 the legacy fleet if you choose to design that (exact gameplay TBD).

REFIT SYSTEM

[K] starts the process of developing a refit of the current design.  Any
 changes made to the design (or to the technology state) will be undone
 upon leaving the refit (for which press [J]).
You can develop a new design based on an existing one ("mar[K]"), which
 reduces development time and cost relative to a clean-sheet design, or
 devise alterations to existing airframes ("m[O]d") which can be applied
 (gradually) to your fleet.  Or explore the effect of changing [D]octrine
 on otherwise unaltered aircraft.

The following cannot be changed in refits:
* Manufacturer
* number of Engines
* Wing
* Bomb Bay capacity or Girth
* Fuselage type

The following changes can be made in marks but not mods:
* change Engine type
* add new Turrets
* add new Crew
* change eLectric supply level
* change fUel capacity

The following changes can be made even in mods:
* remove Turrets
* add Turrets to slots that were originally used on this mark
* remove Crew
* re-add Crew that were originally present on this mark
* change Bombsight
* add or remove Navaids
* toggle fUel tanks Self-sealing

The following can be changed through doctrine:
* dual-rôling of crewmen
