hbuilder - Harris aircraft designer

"It's like SpringStyle, but for bombers."

This is a speculative/long-term project to add the ability for players in
 Harris to design their own aircraft, according to the technologies that
 have been researched by the 'boffins'.

Most of the relevant gameplay rules haven't been nailed down yet; currently
 we're just experimenting with the design calculations.

hb.py implements an early prototype of the calculator, without tech levels.
hbuilder (the C program) will implement the full calculator, and an
 interactive frontend to drive it.  This will doubtless uncover some
 infelicities in the existing design calculations...
